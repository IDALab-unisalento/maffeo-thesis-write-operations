# maffeo-thesis-write-operations

#This project is part of my thesis, which is about IOTA.
#The goal of this project is to send a message to the Tangle inside a zero-value transaction.
#The node_modules folder contains the necessary packages and libraries to make the code work,
#which is contained in the index.json file. The package.json and the package_lock.json file
#contain informations about the project and the version of the used tools.
#This project was inspired by the official guide on the IOTA website, that can be found in
# https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/1.1/first-steps/hello-world
